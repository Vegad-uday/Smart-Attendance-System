# Smart Attendance System

## Project Overview

The **Smart Attendance System** is a project designed to streamline and automate the process of recording attendance using advanced technologies like facial recognition and biometric fingerprint scanning. This system is ideal for educational institutions and organizations, aiming to optimize the teaching-learning time by reducing manual efforts and errors associated with traditional attendance methods.

## Key Features

- **Automated Attendance Recording**: Leverages facial recognition technology to automatically record attendance, eliminating the need for manual entry.
- **Facial Recognition**: Uses OpenCV and dlib to accurately identify individuals through live video streams.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing for easy interaction with the system.
- **Data Management**: Efficient storage and management of attendance records, supporting quick access and retrieval.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Capable of detecting and recognizing faces in real-time through live video streams.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of users without any performance issues.
- **Security**: Ensures secure data storage and is robust against false recognition and unauthorized access.

## Purpose

1. **Automate Attendance Recording**: Replace manual attendance methods with a fully automated system.
2. **Implement Facial Recognition**: Utilize OpenCV and dlib for precise and reliable facial recognition.
3. **Develop a User-Friendly Interface**: Use Tkinter to create an easy-to-navigate interface for users.
4. **Manage and Store Data Efficiently**: Provide a secure and efficient method for managing attendance data.
5. **Enable Real-Time Processing**: Ensure the system can process live video streams in real-time.
6. **Support Scalability**: Make the system scalable for various use cases, including larger institutions.
7. **Enhance Security**: Implement security measures to protect the data and ensure only authorized access.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- face_recognition library
- dlib
- NumPy
- Tkinter
- PIL (Pillow)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vegad-uday/smart-attendance-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd smart-attendance-system
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Place your known face images in the specified directory (`/home/uday/Desktop/De1/De project/` or update the code with your own paths).
5. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Use the interface to manage attendance, view records, and configure settings.
3. The system will automatically detect and recognize faces in real-time using your camera.
4. Attendance records will be stored securely and can be retrieved for review.
